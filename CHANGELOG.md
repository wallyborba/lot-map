# Changelog

What changed in each version of lot-map, newest first. To get a new version, see [Updating](README.md#updating).

## 0.3.9-ume.1 (2026-11-11)

Edição Ume, fork de [alexeyw/lot-map](https://github.com/alexeyw/lot-map) 0.3.8.

- Logo da Ume no centro do mapa (opção `coreLogo`), com a área de respiro da marca. (#2)
- Paleta escura do Ume Design System por padrão, tema `dark`. (#1, #2)
- Lista de eventos nas cores `success` e `error` do tema do Claude. (#2)
- Fonte Geist Mono no mapa, quando instalada. (#1)
- Marketplace renomeado para `ume-lot-map`. (#1)

## 0.3.8 (2026-11-11)

- Italian labels: `language` takes `it`. Contributed by kesi26. (#20)

## 0.3.7 (2026-11-11)

- Background work stays on the map until it ends: a command sent to the background, a monitor, a background subagent or a workflow keeps its row open, and the row closes when the task reports back. A task that failed leaves a fault on its station. (#17)
- A background task's report is no longer drawn as a new message of yours.
- Monitor has its own label on the Shell station.

## 0.3.6 (2026-11-11)

- New option `colors`: colours of your own, by name, as `name=#rrggbb`. (#15)

## 0.3.5 (2026-11-11)

- The route is softer on a light surface, and each leg fades by itself: it stays for 40 seconds and fades over 20. (#14)

## 0.3.4 (2026-11-11)

- The PowerShell tool is read the same way as Bash, with PowerShell's own command names. (#13)
- A quoted path with a space is read as one word, and a Windows program is read by its name: `CURL.EXE` is `curl`.

## 0.3.3 (2026-11-11)

- Windows paths with backslashes are read: the label of a file, the memory folders and the names of commands. Contributed by davidkinsler. (#11)

## 0.3.2 (2026-11-11)

- New option `background`: with `transparent` the map leaves its ground out and the surface shows through. (#10)

## 0.3.1 (2026-11-11)

- Fixed: a password in a web address could reach a label when the address was written in an unusual way. An address that can be read two ways now shows only its scheme. (#6)
- A hook's refusal shows the name of the tool it stopped; its first line shows only with the new option `hookReasons`.
- The word after a memory command shows only if it is listed in the new option `memorySubcommands`.
- A name in `memoryCommands` counts when it is the command itself or begins with it and `-`, `_` or `.`.
- More commands light Network: `rsync`, `nc`, `sftp`, `npm install`, `docker pull` and the like, also inside `$(…)`.
- Control characters are taken out of every label.

## 0.3.0 (2026-11-10)

- New option `layout`: `you-bottom` turns the ring so that you are at the bottom and the network at the top.

## 0.2.0 (2026-11-10)

- The route: a thin line joins the last stations in order.
- Spokes wear in with use, and two clock hands grow around a station while a call runs.
- Memory has a colour of its own; what a hook brought unasked is drawn and counted apart.
- A ring around the centre shows how full the context window is.
- A change of model rings at the centre and gets a row of its own.
- Subagents circle the Agents station.
- Calls that start together fly side by side; a fault leaves a dot until the next message; finished calls at one station fold into one row.
- A light palette and the option `theme`; with `auto` the map follows a light or a dark surface by itself.

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-09)

- The first version: a pane beside the chat with ten stations that light up as memory, files, shell, the network, the model, agents, skills and hooks are used.
- Labels in English, Russian, Spanish, French and German.

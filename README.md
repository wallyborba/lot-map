# lot-map — edição Ume

Fork do [alexeyw/lot-map](https://github.com/alexeyw/lot-map), de Aleksei Volodin, sob licença [MIT](LICENSE). Muda só a aparência:

- paleta escura do Ume Design System por padrão (fundo `#0F0F0F`, Verde Claro para ações, Roxo claro para memória, vermelho `destructive` para erros);
- logo da Ume no centro do mapa (opção `coreLogo`), em Verde Claro no mapa escuro e Cinza Escuro no claro, com a área de respiro da marca; o modelo e o percentual de contexto saem para fora do círculo;
- a lista de eventos usa as cores do tema do Claude (`success` e `error`), que mantêm contraste no app claro e no escuro;
- fonte Geist Mono no mapa, quando estiver instalada.

Instalar:

```bash
claude plugin install lot-map --marketplace wallyborba/ume-lot-map
```

No app desktop: **+** ao lado da caixa de mensagem, **Plugins**, **Add marketplace** com `wallyborba/ume-lot-map`, depois **Add plugin**.

Atualizar:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update ume-lot-map
```

```bash
claude plugin update lot-map@ume-lot-map
```

Quem já tem o original instalado deve removê-lo antes (`claude plugin uninstall lot-map@lot-map`). Para voltar ao visual original, limpe a opção `colors`, ponha `theme` em `auto` e `coreLogo` em `none`. O texto abaixo é o README original.

A mod for Claude Code: a live map of the work, in a pane beside the chat. Every tool call, model step, hook and skill sends a pulse from the centre to its station, so you see memory, files, shell, web and agents at work instead of reading a list of commands.

*A made-up session replayed through the mod's own drawing code. [Video (MP4)](docs/demo.mp4).*

## Install

At the prompt of a terminal session:

```
/plugin install lot-map --marketplace wallyborba/ume-lot-map
```

Answer `y` to add the marketplace, then choose a scope. From a shell:

```bash
claude plugin install lot-map --marketplace wallyborba/ume-lot-map
```

In the desktop app: click **+** next to the prompt box, then **Plugins**, **Add marketplace** with `wallyborba/ume-lot-map`, then **Add plugin**.

The pane opens by itself when a session starts. In a terminal it needs at least 144 columns and draws text only; otherwise type `/lot-map`. Built and tested on Claude Code 2.1.321 on macOS; users report it working on Windows as well.

## Updating

From a shell:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update ume-lot-map
claude plugin update lot-map@ume-lot-map
```

Then start a new session. The first command is needed: without it the second one reports the installed version as the latest.

What each version changed is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## What lights up

| Station | When |
| --- | --- |
| You | your messages, questions and files sent to you |
| Model | each model request, context compaction |
| Memory | Claude Code's memory folder, plus whatever you name in the options |
| Files | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, and shell commands that work on files and nothing else: they read, search, move, delete or edit in place (`cat`, `grep`, `mv`, `sed -i`, `tee`, `find … -delete`) |
| Shell | every other shell command |
| Network | web fetch and search, MCP servers, and shell commands known to reach the network: `curl`, `gh`, `ssh`, `rsync`, `git push`, `npm install`, `docker pull` and the like, also inside `$(…)` |
| Browser | browser tools |
| Agents | subagents and workflows; their own calls start from this station |
| Skills | skills and tool search |
| Hooks | settings hooks that refuse a call, ask for permission, add context or take a moment |

On Windows the PowerShell tool is read the same way as Bash, with PowerShell's own names: `Get-Content` and `Select-String` light Files, `Invoke-WebRequest` lights Network. A program run by its full path is read by its name, also from a quoted path with a space, and `CURL.EXE` is `curl`.

The shell stations go by the command's name, not by what it does: a script that opens a connection itself, such as `python -c "…"`, shows as Shell.

A pulse flies out when something starts and returns when it ends. Refusals and errors turn red.

## Reading the map

- **The route.** A thin line joins the last few stations the main loop went through, in order, and its newest leg draws itself. A leg stays for 40 seconds and then fades over 20, so a minute after the work stops only the spokes are left; their thickness keeps where the work went. Model steps are left out, or every leg would pass through Model.
- **Worn spokes.** A spoke grows thicker and brighter the more its station is used, so at the end of a session the map shows where the work went.
- **How long.** Two clock hands grow around a station while a call runs: the inner one goes round in a minute, the outer one in ten.
- **Background work.** A command sent to the background, a monitor, a background subagent or a workflow stays lit on its station after the turn that started it is over, with the clock hands growing, until the task reports that it ended. A task that failed leaves the red dot. The report itself is not shown as a message of yours.
- **Several at once.** Calls that start together fly side by side, and the station carries their number, such as `×3`.
- **What went wrong.** A red dot with a count stays on a station from an error or a refusal until your next message.
- **Memory.** It has a colour of its own. A solid pulse is a memory Claude asked for; a hollow one on a dashed line is what a hook brought unasked. Under the station, the plain number counts the first and `↓` the second.
- **The context window.** The ring around the centre fills as the session goes, with the percentage above the name. It turns amber at 70% and red at 90%.
- **A change of model.** The centre and the Model station ring for a few seconds, and the feed gets a row such as `opus 5.5 → fable 5.2`. This also happens when a session starts on a different model from the last session in the same folder.
- **Subagents.** Each one still at work circles the Agents station as a small dot, and its calls start from there.
- **The answer.** One wide ring leaves the centre when the answer is ready.

Below the map are the current action with the context percentage, and the last 16 rows: `●` running, `·` done, `✕` failed or blocked, `◆` a change of model. Finished calls that follow one another at one station fold into one row, marked `+2` for the two it stands for besides the one named.

## Options

The install offers them on a screen. Later, use `/config` in a terminal or `claude plugin configure`, then restart the session.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `language` | `en` | `en`, `ru`, `es`, `fr`, `de` or `it` |
| `coreName` | `CLAUDE` | what the circle in the middle says, up to ten characters |
| `memoryServers` | `memory` | MCP servers whose tools light Memory |
| `memoryCommands` | none | shell commands or scripts that light Memory; a name counts when it is the command itself or begins with it and `-`, `_` or `.`, so `recall` also names `recall-sync.py` |
| `memorySubcommands` | none | words after a memory command that the map may show, such as `add` or `search`; without them the command goes by its own name |
| `memoryPaths` | none | parts of a path that make a file a memory |
| `memoryLabels` | none | short names for memory tools, each as `tool=name` |
| `hookRecords` | `false` | turn on if a hook of yours adds memory records numbered like `[#123]`; they appear on Memory by number only. Such a number in the text of any hook counts, not only a memory hook's |
| `hookReasons` | `false` | show the first line of a hook's refusal, up to 72 characters; off, the map says only which tool was stopped |
| `theme` | `auto` | the map's colours: `dark`, `light`, or `auto`, which is dark on a dark surface and light on a light one |
| `background` | `solid` | the map's own background, or `transparent`, which lets the pane behind it show through. The rim around the labels keeps the background's colour, so on a surface of another shade it shows as a faint halo |
| `colors` | none | colours of your own, each as `name=#rrggbb`; see [Colours of your own](#colours-of-your-own) |
| `layout` | `you-top` | where you are on the map: `you-top`, or `you-bottom`, which turns the ring half a turn so that you are at the bottom and the network and the browser at the top |

For example, Russian labels and your own memory server:

```bash
echo '{"language":"ru","memoryServers":"my-memory"}' | claude plugin configure lot-map@ume-lot-map --values-stdin
```

Lists are written with commas.

| Russian labels | `layout` set to `you-bottom` |

## Colours of your own

`colors` replaces the map's colours one by one. Set one, a few, or all thirteen; what you leave out stays as it is.

```bash
echo '{"theme":"dark","colors":"accent=#7fb4ff,active=#b8d6ff,text=#e6edf7"}' | claude plugin configure lot-map@ume-lot-map --values-stdin
```

| Name | What it colours |
| --- | --- |
| `background` | the map's ground, and the rim around the labels |
| `node` | the inside of a station and of the centre |
| `line`, `spoke` | the dashed contours and the idle spokes |
| `text`, `label`, `faint` | the name in the centre and lit labels, the other labels, the counts |
| `accent`, `active` | the main colour, and a station at work |
| `error` | errors and refusals |
| `memory`, `memoryActive` | the Memory station and its spoke |
| `route` | the route between stations |

<img src="docs/map-colors.png" width="640" alt="The map in two palettes of one's own: a cool blue one and a green one">

- Only `#rgb` and `#rrggbb` are taken. Anything else, and any other name, counts as not set.
- With `theme` left on `auto`, a colour of your own holds on a light surface as well, and the rest is repainted as before. With a whole palette of your own, set `theme` to `dark` or `light`.
- With `background` set to `transparent`, still give `background` here the colour of your pane: the rim around the labels takes it, and the halo is gone.

## What it shows and what it keeps

The mod makes no network requests, reads no files, runs no processes, calls no model and adds nothing to the conversation. Its rows live only for the session.

Like any mod that follows tool calls, it is handed every call's whole input, including command lines and the text written to files. It takes names from that and nothing else; the code that does so is `classify` in `hooks/map.ts`. A marketplace added from this repository follows its `main` branch, so an update brings whatever is there: read the diff before updating if that matters to you.

It asks Claude Code for one thing: how full the context window is, after each model step. Between sessions it keeps one thing, the name of the model last used in each folder, so that it can show a change. Each is stored under the folder's full path, in Claude Code's own store for the plugin.

A label holds a name, never content:

- a file: the last two parts of its path;
- a web address: the host alone, without a login, password, path or query; an address that can be read two ways shows only its scheme;
- a shell command: the short description Claude wrote for it, or the command's name, never the command line;
- a memory call: the tool's name and a record number or short identifier, never the text or the query;
- a memory command: its name, and the word after it only if you listed that word in `memorySubcommands`;
- a subagent: the short description it was started with;
- a background task's report: that the task ended and whether it failed, never its summary or its output;
- a hook's refusal: the name of the tool it stopped. Its first line shows only with `hookReasons` on, because a refusal may quote what the hook found.

Control characters are taken out of every label before it is drawn.

A fault on the map never reaches a tool call or a model turn.

## Developing

```bash
claude plugin test .
claude plugin validate .
```

Words live in `hooks/text.ts`; a new language is one more table there and one more value of `language` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
